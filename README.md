# PowerPoint Scraper

Blazingly Fast And Cool, but not as easy as NextJS yet, since seperation of islands and components is quite confusing, and types are harder since I am not used to the coming from PReact instead of React

Otherwise Would recommend trying out!!
### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
